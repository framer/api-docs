# Animation

<span className="lead">
  A set of properties and helpers for high-performance,
  declarative animations.
</span>

<div>

Animations in Framer are primarily controlled via the `Frame` component. The key properties are `animate` and `transition`, which take a variety of options to customize animations. All the animation properties and helpers are included when you import `Frame`, with the exception of `useCycle`.
You can find all the `Frame` animation properties and methods [here](../frame/#animation).

</div>

```jsx
import * as React from "react"
import { Frame } from "framer"

export function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <Frame
      animate={{ rotate: 360 }}
      transition={{ duration: 2 }}
    />
  )
}
```
