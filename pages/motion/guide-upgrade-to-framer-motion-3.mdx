# Upgrade to Motion 3

<span className="lead">
  How to upgrade Framer Motion from 2.x to 3.x
</span>

Framer Motion 3 is major release but the type of breaking change is very specific and very small. It's unlikely, though possible, to change the way your animations function.

## The changing behaviour

Motion 3 features a centralisation of how animation states are computed.

All animation props are now ranked in terms of priority (left being lowest, right being highest).

```javascript
const priority = ["animate", "while-", "exit"]
```

When one of those props changes, or becomes active/inactive, we will recompute the necessary animations. This is an extension and codification of a behaviour that was partially implemented only for the `while` props, leading to a more consistent and predictable experience.

This leads to a few behavioural changes:

### Multi-variant props

**Before**, only `animate` could accept a list of variants.

```jsx
<motion.div animate={["active", "warning"]} />
```

**Now**, all animation props can.

```jsx
<motion.div whileHover={["hover", "secondary"]} />
```

### Live animation props

**Before**, `while-` props and `exit` were only animated to/from when those states became active/inactive. So any changes to `whileHover` while that gesture was active were ignored.

**Now**, if the contents of `whileHover` or `exit` (etc) change while that state is active, that change will be respected and animated to.

### Removing animation values

**Before**, if a value was outright removed from an animation prop, nothing would happen.

**Now**, if a value is removed, we check for it in the next highest-priority animation state. For instance, if `opacity` is removed from `whileHover`, Motion will check for it in `animate` and animate to that.

If we don't find one in `animate`, it'll check in `style`, or fallback to its initially-recorded value (for instance if the value was initially read from the DOM because none was explicitly defined).

## That's all!

These are subtle changes that will probably not affect the majority of projects, but they're worth being aware of.

Motion 3 seems much smaller in scope than 2, and it is! But it provides a much stronger base for variants and animation props going forward.
