# Handover from Framer X

<span className="lead">
  How to convert interactive Framer X prototypes into
  production.
</span>

Framer Motion is the library driving Framer X's animation and gesture capabilities, so converting prototypes into production-level code is usually straightforward.

In this guide we'll cover the main differences between the libraries.

## Striking a balance

Every API has to strike a balance between simplicity, flexibility, performance, file-size, and more.

That ideal balance is different depending on whether our code is being used in a prototype, or being deployed in a production environment. Whether it's bei9ng consumed by a designer, or a developer. This is why Framer Motion presents a different API than Framer Library.

## Frame vs Motion components

The single biggest difference between the two APIs is that in Framer Library the fundamental building block is a `Frame`, while Framer Motion uses `motion` components.

A `Frame` is always a `div`, and offers a number of top-level convenience style props like `x`. It also makes big assumptions about the `div`'s default styles, like `position: "absolute"` and `width: 100`.

```jsx
<Frame x={100} />
```

For a semantic web, there's a `motion` component for every valid HTML and SVG element. They offer the same animation and gesture API as a `Frame` as well as individual transform shortcuts like `x` and `scale`, but they're otherwise identical to their underlying element.

```jsx
<motion.div style={{ x: 100 }} />
```

## MotionValues

With a `Frame`, `MotionValue`s are injected where you'd statically set a visual prop, which is usually via the top-level props.

```jsx
const x = useMotionValue(0)

return <Frame x={x} />
```

The same is true for `motion` components. So for HTML components, this is via the `style` property.

```jsx
const x = useMotionValue(0)

<motion.div style={{ x }} />
```

For SVG, via the prop or `style` property.

```jsx
const cx = useMotionValue(0)
const scale = useMotionValue(1)
const originX = useMotionValue(0.5)

<motion.circle cx={cx} style={{ scale, originX }} />
```

## Color support

Framer Library offers the `Color` primitive. This allows animation between named colors, and/or different types of color (ie RGBA to HSLA).

```jsx
<Frame
  initial={{ backgroundColor: Color("red") }}
  animate={{ backgroundColor: Color("#fff") }}
/>
```

The code that interpolates between different color spaces is quite large. It's useful in a prototype environment but in production style guides and design systems usually define colors in a single color space.

For this reason Framer Motion only supports animating colors between RGBA/Hex, **or** HSLA. It also doesn't support the animation of named colors.

```jsx
<motion.div
  initial={{ backgroundColor: "#f00" }}
  animate={{ backgroundColor: "#fff" }}
/>
```
