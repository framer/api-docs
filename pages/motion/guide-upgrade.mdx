# Upgrade guides

<span className="lead">
  How to upgrade to the latest version of Framer Motion
</span>

## 4.0

Framer Motion 4 introduces a brand new `LazyMotion` component to help reduce bundle size.

Previously, a subset of `motion` functionality could be loaded in synchronously or asynchronously via `MotionConfig`'s `features` prop. This functionality has been removed in favour of the new `LazyMotion` component.

Check out the new [reduce bundle size](/api/motion/guide-reduce-bundle-size) guide to find out how to use this new API.

## 3.0

Framer Motion 3 is major release but the type of breaking change is very specific and very small. It's unlikely, though possible, to change the way your animations function.

### The changing behaviour

Motion 3 features a centralisation of how animation states are computed.

All animation props are now ranked in terms of priority (left being lowest, right being highest).

```javascript
const priority = ["animate", "while-", "exit"]
```

When one of those props changes, or becomes active/inactive, we will recompute the necessary animations. This is an extension and codification of a behaviour that was partially implemented only for the `while` props, leading to a more consistent and predictable experience.

This leads to a few behavioural changes:

### Multi-variant props

**Before**, only `animate` could accept a list of variants.

```jsx
<motion.div animate={["active", "warning"]} />
```

**Now**, all animation props can.

```jsx
<motion.div whileHover={["hover", "secondary"]} />
```

### Live animation props

**Before**, `while-` props and `exit` were only animated to/from when those states became active/inactive. So any changes to `whileHover` while that gesture was active were ignored.

**Now**, if the contents of `whileHover` or `exit` (etc) change while that state is active, that change will be respected and animated to.

### Removing animation values

**Before**, if a value was outright removed from an animation prop, nothing would happen.

**Now**, if a value is removed, we check for it in the next highest-priority animation state. For instance, if `opacity` is removed from `whileHover`, Motion will check for it in `animate` and animate to that.

If we don't find one in `animate`, it'll check in `style`, or fallback to its initially-recorded value (for instance if the value was initially read from the DOM because none was explicitly defined).

## That's all!

These are subtle changes that will probably not affect the majority of projects, but they're worth being aware of.

Motion 3 seems much smaller in scope than 2, and it is! But it provides a much stronger base for variants and animation props going forward.


## 2.0

Framer Motion 2 is major release and that means there's API changes. In this guide we'll take a look at how you can upgrade your code to ensure it continues to work as expected, and highlight some features that will be broken in the new version of Motion.

### Layout animations

Framer Motion 1 supported a couple of ways to perform layout animations, the `positionTransition` and `layoutTransition` props.

```jsx
// Before
<motion.div layoutTransition />
```

In Framer Motion 2, these have both been superseded by the `layout` prop.

```jsx
// After
<motion.div layout />
```

Both of the old props used to take a transition as an argument.

```jsx
// Before
<motion.div layoutTransition={{ duration: 2 }} />
```

Now, layout animations use the same default `transition` prop as other animations.

```jsx
// After
<motion.div layout transition={{ duration: 2 }} />
```

In Framer Motion 1, layout animations could distort `borderRadius` and `boxShadow` properties on components that were changing size. This is now fixed if either property is animated.

```jsx
<motion.div layout initial={{ borderRadius: 20 }} />
```

<div>

Layout animations that changed size could also distort child components. This can now be corrected by providing them with a `layout` prop, too.

Only immediate children will need to be corrected for scale.

</div>

```jsx
<motion.div layout>
  <motion.div layout />
</motion.div>
```

### Breaking changes

There are some changes that don't have an immediate fix that you should be aware of before upgrading.

#### Drag

Drag has been refactored to use the same layout projection rendering methodology that powers Motion 2's layout animations to ensure the two features are fully compatible with each other.

This has lead to some breaking changes:

- Drag listeners (like `onDrag`) now report the `point` relative to the viewport, moving in line with other pointer gestures in Motion.
- `dragOriginX` and `dragOriginY` have been removed. These were added to allow a hacky way to make `positionTransition` compatible with `drag`, but `layout` is compatible with `drag` by default.

#### useAnimatedState

The `useAnimatedState` API was an experimental and undocumented API for use in Framer X. This has now been removed.
