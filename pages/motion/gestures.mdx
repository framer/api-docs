# Gestures

<span className="lead">
  A powerful gesture recognition system for the browser.
</span>

<div>

Motion extends the basic set of event listeners provided by React with a simple yet powerful set of UI gesture recognisers.

It currently has support for hover, tap, pan and drag gesture detection. Each gesture has a series of event listeners that you can attach to your `motion` component.

</div>

## Animation helpers

<div>

`motion` components provide two helper props: `whileHover` and `whileTap`. These can define animation targets to temporarily animate to while a gesture is active.

</div>

```jsx
<motion.button
  whileHover={{
    scale: 1.2,
    transition: { duration: 1 },
  }}
  whileTap={{ scale: 0.9 }}
/>
```

<div>

Both props can be set either as a target of values to animate to, or the name of any variants defined via the `variants` prop. Variants will flow down through children as normal.

</div>

```jsx
<motion.button
  whileTap="tap"
  whileHover="hover"
  variants={buttonVariants}
>
  <svg>
    <motion.path variants={iconVariants} />
  </svg>
</motion.button>
```

`motion` components automatically manage the interplay between the these `while` props. So for instance, if hovering starts and stops while the tap gesture is active, the tap gesture receives priority and any properties defined on both will remain in their tapped state.

Likewise, if both gestures are defined and tapping ends, the component will know to animate either to the state defined in `whileHover`, or the component's original state, depending on whether tapping ends inside or outside of the component.

### A note on SVG filters

The `while` helper properties won't work on SVG `filter` components, as these elements don't have a physical presence and therefore don't receive events. To respond to gestures, you need to introduce React state to the component and attach listeners to the physical element.

```jsx
const MyComponent = () => {
  const [isHovered, setHovered] = useState(false)

  // Simplified example
  return (
    <svg>
      <image
        filter="url(#blur)"
        onMouseEnter={() => setHovered(true)}
        onMouseLeave={() => setHovered(false)}
      />
      <filter id="blur">
        <motion.feGaussianBlur
          initial={false}
          animate={{ stdDeviation: isHovered ? 0 : 2 }}
        />
      </filter>
    </svg>
  )
}
```

## Hover

<div>

The hover gesture detects when a pointer hovers over or leaves a component.

It differs from `onMouseEnter` and `onMouseLeave` in that hover is guaranteed to only fire as a result of actual mouse events (as opposed to browser-generated mice events emulated from touch input).

</div>

```jsx
<motion.a
  whileHover={{ scale: 1.2 }}
  onHoverStart={e => {}}
  onHoverEnd={e => {}}
/>
```

<APIProperty name="HoverHandlers.whileHover" />
<APIMethod name="HoverHandlers.onHoverStart()" />
<APIMethod name="HoverHandlers.onHoverEnd()" />

## Tap

<div>

The tap gesture detects when a pointer presses down and releases on the same component.

It fires an `tap` event when tapping successfully completes on an component, and a `tapCancel` event when tapping ends outside the component.

If the tappable component is a child of a draggable component, it'll automatically cancel the tap gesture if the pointer moves further than 3 pixels during the gesture.

</div>

<APIProperty name="TapHandlers.whileTap" />
<APIMethod name="TapHandlers.onTap()" />
<APIMethod name="TapHandlers.onTapStart()" />
<APIMethod name="TapHandlers.onTapCancel()" />

## Pan

The pan gesture recognises when a pointer presses down on a component and moves further than 3 pixels. The pan gesture is ended when the pointer is released.

```jsx
<motion.div onPan={(e, pointInfo) => {}} />
```

<APIMethod name="PanHandlers.onPan()" />
<APIMethod name="PanHandlers.onPanStart()" />
<APIMethod name="PanHandlers.onPanEnd()" />

## Drag

The drag gesture follows the rules of the pan gesture but applies pointer movement to the x and/or y axis of the component.

```jsx
<motion.div drag />
```

<APIProperty name="DraggableProps.drag" />
<APIProperty name="DraggableProps.dragConstraints" />
<APIProperty name="DraggableProps.dragElastic" />
<APIProperty name="DraggableProps.dragMomentum" />
<APIProperty name="DraggableProps.dragTransition" />
<APIProperty name="DraggableProps.dragPropagation" />

<APIMethod name="DragHandlers.onDrag()" />
<APIMethod name="DragHandlers.onDragStart()" />
<APIMethod name="DragHandlers.onDragEnd()" />
<APIMethod name="DragHandlers.onDirectionLock()" />
