# Gestures

<span className="lead">
  A powerful gesture recognition system for the browser.
</span>

<div>

Framer Motion extends the basic set of event listeners provided by React with a simple yet powerful set of UI gesture recognisers.

It currently has support for hover, tap, pan and drag gesture detection. Each gesture has a series of event listeners LINK TO MOTION PROPS HERE that you can attach to your `motion` component.

</div>

## Gesture-triggered animations

<div>

`motion` components provide two convinience props, `whileHover` and `whileTap`, that can define animation targets to temporarily animate to while a gesture is active.

</div>

```jsx
<motion.button
  whileHover={{
    scale: 1.2,
    transition: { duration: 1 },
  }}
  whileTap={{ scale: 0.9 }}
/>
```

<div>

Both props can be set either as a target of values to animate to, or the name of any variants defined via the `variants` prop. Variants will flow down through children as normal.

</div>

```jsx
<motion.button
  whileTap="tap"
  whileHover="hover"
  variants={buttonVariants}
>
  <svg>
    <motion.path variants={iconVariants} />
  </svg>
</motion.button>
```

`motion` components automatically manage the interplay between the these gestures. So for instance, if hovering starts and stops while the tap gesture is active, the tap gesture receives priority and any properties defined on both will remain in their tapped state.

Likewise, if both gestures are defined and tapping ends, the component will know to animate either to the state defined in `whileHover`, or the component's original state, depending on whether tapping ends inside or outside of the component.

### A note on SVG filters

The `while` helper properties won't work on SVG `filter` components, as these elements don't have a physical presence and therefore don't receive events. To respond to gestures, you need to introduce React state to the component and attach listeners to the physical element.

```jsx
const MyComponent = () => {
  const [isHovered, setHovered] = useState(false)

  // Simplified example
  return (
    <svg>
      <image
        filter="url(#blur)"
        onMouseEnter={() => setHovered(true)}
        onMouseLeave={() => setHovered(false)}
      />
      <filter id="blur">
        <motion.feGaussianBlur
          initial={false}
          animate={{ stdDeviation: isHovered ? 0 : 2 }}
        />
      </filter>
    </svg>
  )
}
```

## Hover

The hover gesture differs from mouse events like `onMouseEnter` and `onMouseLeave` in that they're guaranteed to only fire as a result of actual mouse events (as opposed to browser-generated mice events emulated from touch input).

## Tap

## Pan

## Drag
