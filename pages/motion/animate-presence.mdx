# AnimatePresence

<span className="lead">
  Animate components as they're removed from the React tree.
</span>

<div>

Wrapping one or more `motion` components in `AnimatePresence` enables the use of an `exit` prop, which can define an animation to use when a component is unmounted.

It can also be used to suppress initial animations only on components that are present when it first mounts.

</div>

```jsx
import { motion, AnimatePresence } from "framer-motion"

export const MyComponent = ({ isVisible }) => (
  <AnimatePresence>
    {isVisible && (
      <motion.div
        initial={{ opacity: 0 }}
        animate={{ opacity: 1 }}
        exit={{ opacity: 0 }}
      />
    )}
  </AnimatePresence>
)
```

## Usage

### Unmount animations

`AnimatePresence` allows components to animate out when they're removed from the React tree.

The reason a seperate component is required for this is that React lacks a lifecycle method that:

1. Notifies components when they're going to be unmounted and
2. Allows them to defer that unmounting until after an operation is complete (for instance an animation).

<div>

Wrap one or more `motion` components with `AnimatePresence`. This enables the use of an `exit` prop, which can define a state for the component to animate to before it's unmounted from the DOM.

**Note:** Child `motion` components must each have a unique `key` prop so `AnimatePresence` can track their presence in the tree.

</div>

```jsx
const MyComponent = ({ isVisible }) => (
  <AnimatePresence>
    {isVisible && (
      <motion.div
        key="modal"
        initial={{ opacity: 0 }}
        animate={{ opacity: 1 }}
        exit={{ opacity: 0 }}
      />
    )}
  </AnimatePresence>
)
```

Like `initial` and `animate`, `exit` can be defined either as a `TargetAndTransition` object of values, or a variant label to animate out a whole tree.

<div>

In React, changing a component's `key` makes React treat it as an entirely new component. So the old one is unmounted before the new one is mounted. So by changing the `key` of a single child of `AnimatePresence`, we can easily make components like slideshows.

<Button
  name="Open example in CodeSandbox"
  link="https://codesandbox.io/s/framer-motion-image-gallery-pqvx3?fontsize=14&module=%2Fsrc%2FExample.tsx"
/>

</div>

<EmbeddedExample background="#151515">
  <AnimatePresenceExample />
</EmbeddedExample>

```jsx
export const Slideshow = ({ image }) => (
  <AnimatePresence>
    <motion.img
      key={image.src}
      src={image.src}
      initial={{ x: 300, opacity: 0 }}
      animate={{ x: 0, opacity: 1 }}
      exit={{ x: -300, opacity: 0 }}
    />
  </AnimatePresence>
)
```

### Multiple children

<div>

`AnimatePresence` works the same way with multiple children. Just ensure that each has a unique `key` and components will animate in and out as they're added or removed from the tree.

</div>

```jsx
export const Notifications = ({ messages }) => (
  <AnimatePresence>
    {messages.map(({ id, content }) => (
      <motion.li
        key={id}
        animate={{ opacity: 1 }}
        exit={{ opacity: 0 }}
      >
        {content}
      </motion.li>
    ))}
  </AnimatePresence>
)
```

Add a [`positionTransition` prop](/api/motion/component/#animationprops.positiontransition) to the child components to allow them to smoothly animate into their new positions when an item is removed.

```jsx
<motion.li positionTransition exit={{ opacity: 0 }} />
```

### Suppressing initial animations

<div>

Mount animations are already handled by `motion` components via the `initial` and `animate` props.

If a `motion` component is set to `initial={false}`, it'll start in the state defined in `animate`. But sometimes, for instance a chatbox or a slideshow, we only want to animate in new components, that are added after the initial render.

By setting `initial={false}` on `AnimatePresence`, components present when `AnimatePresence` first loads will start in their `animate` state. Only components that enter after this initial render will animate in.

</div>

```jsx highlight(2, 5-6)
const MyComponent = ({ isVisible }) => (
  <AnimatePresence initial={false}>
    {isVisible && (
      <motion.div
        initial={{ opacity: 0 }}
        animate={{ opacity: 1 }}
        exit={{ opacity: 0 }}
      />
    )}
  </AnimatePresence>
)
```

### Animating custom components

<div>

The children of `AnimatePresence` can be a custom component. The way `AnimatePresence` works is by taking the `exit` prop and providing it to `animate`. It also provides an `onAnimationComplete` that lets it know when it's safe to unmount the child.

So to use a custom component you just have to make sure that:

1. The custom component is defined with an `exit` prop.
2. The `animate` and `onAnimationComplete` props are forwarded to an underlying `motion` component.

This is a temporary API restriction that will be removed in a future release.

</div>

```jsx
const Item = ({ animate, onAnimationComplete }) => (
  <motion.div
    animate={animate}
    onAnimationComplete={onAnimationComplete}
  />
)

export const MyComponent = ({ items }) => (
  <AnimatePresence>
    {items.map(({ id }) => (
      <Item key={id} exit={{ opacity: 0 }} />
    ))}
  </AnimatePresence>
)
```
