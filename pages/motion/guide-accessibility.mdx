<span className="lead">
  How to design accessible animations with Framer Motion.
</span>

Framer Motion provides the [the useReducedMotion hook](/api/motion/motionvalue/#usereducedmotion) to let you deal with devices that have the Reduced Motion setting enabled.

```jsx
const isReducedMotion = useReducedMotion()
```

Plenty of [excellent](https://alistapart.com/blog/post/more-resources-for-accessible-animations/) [guides](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/04/designing-accessibility-inclusion/) about _why_ and _how_ we should design accessible animations, so in this guide we're briefly going to cover the practicalities of some basic implementations.

## Using opacity instead of position

In most cases, you'll still want to show a transition between two states, but reduce motion sickness. A good way to do this is to replace show/hide animations that use positional animations with ones that use opacity.

```jsx
function Component({ isOpen }) {
  const isReducedMotion = useReducedMotion()
  let animate

  if (isOpen) {
    animate = isReducedMotion ? { opacity: 1 } : { x: 0 }
  } else {
    animate = isReducedMotion
      ? { opacity: 0 }
      : { x: "-100%" }
  }

  return <motion.div animate={animate} />
}
```

## Disable parallax

Parallax animations can be very unpleasant for people pre-disposed to motion sickness.

To build parallax, we usually get `scrollY` from `useViewportScroll`, and create a new `MotionValue` via passing that to `useTransform` which will update's a `motion` component's `y` position as the scroll value changes.

To disable this for reduced motion devices, we can conditionally pass a target range `[0, 0]`, so scroll changes have no effect.

```jsx
function Component() {
  const isReducedMotion = useReducedMotion()
  const { scrollY } = useViewportScroll()

  const y = useTransform(
    scrollY,
    [0, 1],
    isReducedMotion ? [0, 0] : [0, -0.2],
    { clamp: false }
  )

  return <motion.div style={{ y }} />
}
```

## Disable auto-playing videos

`useReducedMotion` isn't only compatible with Framer Motion's API. It returns a simple boolean, so you can use it for any purpose, like disabling the autoplay of a background `video` element.

```jsx
function BackgroundVideo() {
  const isReducedMotion = useReducedMotion()

  return <video autoplay={!isReducedMotion} />
}
```
