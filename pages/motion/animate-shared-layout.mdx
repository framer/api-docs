# AnimateSharedLayout

<span className="lead">
  Animate between different components that share a layout
  ID.
</span>

<div>

`AnimateSharedLayout` allows animation between seperate components.

These components do not need to be rendered in the same hierarchy, as long as they share the same `layoutId`, and are wrapped within the same `AnimateSharedLayout` component.

This can be used to create a variety of effects, like this underline selection:

<iframe
  src="https://codesandbox.io/embed/framer-motion-magic-motion-underline-menu-demo-y6tl3?fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&hidedevtools=1&theme=dark"
  style={{
    width: "100%",
    height: "500px",
    border: 0,
    borderRadius: 4,
    overflow: "hidden",
    marginBottom: 40,
  }}
  title="Framer Motion: Magic Motion underline menu demo"
  allow="geolocation; microphone; camera; midi; vr; accelerometer; gyroscope; payment; ambient-light-sensor; encrypted-media; usb"
  sandbox="allow-modals allow-forms allow-popups allow-scripts allow-same-origin"
></iframe>

Or fully route-driven shared element transitions (try pressing back from the overlay):

<iframe
  src="https://codesandbox.io/embed/framer-motion-magic-motion-app-store-demo-su6mx?fontsize=14&hidenavigation=0&hidedevtools=1&theme=dark"
  style={{
    width: "100%",
    height: "500px",
    border: 0,
    borderRadius: 4,
    overflow: "hidden",
    marginBottom: 40,
  }}
  title="Framer Motion: Magic Motion App Store demo"
  allow="geolocation; microphone; camera; midi; vr; accelerometer; gyroscope; payment; ambient-light-sensor; encrypted-media; usb"
  sandbox="allow-modals allow-forms allow-popups allow-scripts allow-same-origin"
></iframe>

## Usage

### Shared layout animations

When a new component is added with an existing `layoutId`, on mount it will visually animate out from the previous component that had or has the same `layoutId`.

```jsx
import { motion, AnimateSharedLayout } from "framer-motion"

export const MyComponent = ({ items, selectedId }) => (
  <AnimateSharedLayout>
    {items.map(item => (
      <li>
        {item.title}
        {item.id === selectedId && (
          <motion.div layoutId="underline" />
        )}
      </li>
    ))}
  </AnimateSharedLayout>
)
```

If the previous component still exists in the tree, it'll automatically be hidden using `opacity: 0`, but still occupy space in the layout.

### Exit animations

<div>

When a component that's expected to enter and exit the tree is wrapped in `AnimatePresence`, it'll automatically animate back to the original component with its `layoutId` when it's removed.

<Button
  name="Open example in CodeSandbox"
  link="https://codesandbox.io/s/framer-motion-magic-motion-gallery-demo-pknk7"
/>

</div>

```jsx
<AnimateSharedLayout>
  {images.map((img) => <motion.img layoutId={img.id} />)}
  <AnimatePresence>
    {selectedId && <motion.img layoutId={selectedId} />)}
  </AnimatePresence>
</AnimateSharedLayout>
```

### Crossfade

<div>

Sometimes, the components that you are animating from/to might look different enough that when an entering/exiting component is added or removed there is an obvious visual switch. For instance, a text box might be wrapped differently in one layout than another.

By setting `type="crossfade"`, both the exiting and previous components will animate together. The root components in each stack that has either `animate={true}` or a `layoutId` will crossfade, so one gets hidden as the other is revealed.

<Button
  name="Open example in CodeSandbox"
  link="https://codesandbox.io/s/framer-motion-magic-motion-app-store-demo-su6mx"
/>

</div>

```jsx
<AnimateSharedLayout type="crossfade">
  {images.map((img) => <motion.img layoutId={img.id} />)}
  <AnimatePresence>
    {selectedId && <motion.img layoutId={selectedId} />)}
  </AnimatePresence>
</AnimateSharedLayout>
```

### Transition customisation

<div>

The transition used for the shared layout animation is defined in the [component's `transition` prop](/api/motion/types#transition).

This accepts all the same `Transition` settings as usual. Currently it is only possible to set a single transition for all child components. Using individual values per child component is not supported. This limitation will be removed in a future release.

</div>

```jsx
<AnimateSharedLayout transition={{ duration: 2 }}>
```

### Correcting visual distortion

For maximum performance, layouts are animated using the `transform` property. Animating `width` and `height` using `scaleX` and `scaleY` can introduce visual distortion on children.

This can be automatically corrected by applying `animate` to those children.

```jsx
<motion.div sharedId="container">
  <motion.div animate />
</motion.div>
```
