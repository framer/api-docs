# Animation

<span className="lead">
  A set of properties and helpers for high-performance,
  declarative animations.
</span>

<div>

Animations in Framer Motion are primarily controlled via the `motion` component's `animate` property.

It can accept a target object, variant label(s), or imperative animation controls. We'll explore each on this page.

</div>

```jsx
import { motion } from "framer-motion"

export const MyComponent = () => (
  <motion.div
    animate={{ rotate: 360 }}
    transition={{ duration: 2 }}
  />
)
```

---

## Target object

The simplest way to make a component animate is to pass a target object to a component's `animate` prop.

```jsx
<motion.div animate={{ x: 100 }} />
```

When any value in `animate` changes, the component will automatically animate to the updated target.

### Transitions

By default, Framer Motion will create an appropriate animation for a snappy transition based on the types of value being animated. For instance, physical properties like `x` or `scale` will be animated via a spring simulation. Whereas values like `opacity` or `color` will be animated with a tween.

However, you can set different types of animation by passing a `Transition` to the `transition` prop.

```jsx
<motion.div
  animate={{ x: 100 }}
  transition={{ ease: "easeOut", duration: 2 }}
/>
```

### Mount animations

When a component mounts, it'll automatically animate to the values in `animate` if they're different from those defined in `style` or `initial`. You can set the `initial` prop to `false` to use the value in `animate` as the component's mounted state to disable mount animations.

```jsx
<motion.div animate={{ x: 100 }} initial={false} />
```

This will also work with server-side rendering.

### Keyframes

<div>

Values in `animate` can also be set as a series of keyframes. This will animate through each value in sequence.

</div>

```jsx
<motion.feGaussianBlur
  animate={{ stdDeviation: [0, 5, 0] }}
/>
```

<div>

By default, a keyframes animation will start with the first item in the array. To use the **current** value instead, `null` can be passed as a placeholder. This way, if a keyframes animation starts while the value is currently animating, the transition will be more natural.

</div>

```jsx
<motion.circle cx={500} animate={{ cx: [null, 100] }} />
```

<div>

Each of these keyframes will be spaced equidistantly throughout the animation, but you can override this by setting a `times` prop on the `transition` prop.

This is an array of the same length as the animation target with numbers between `0` and `1` that define when in the animation each keyframe should be hit.

</div>

```jsx
<motion.circle
  cx={500}
  animate={{ cx: [null, 100, 200] }}
  transition={{ duration: 3, times: [0, 0.2, 1] }}
/>
```

## Variants

Setting props directly is great for simple use cases.

### Transition

The `transition` property can be used to set a **default transition** for all animations on a motion component. ADD LINK TO TRANSITION TYPE HERE

```jsx
<motion.div
  animate={{ scale: 0.5 }}
  transition={{ ease: "easeOut" }}
/>
```

You can override this transition by adding `transition` to any prop that accepts an animation target (like `animate`, `whileHover`, `whilePress` etc).

```jsx
<motion.div
  transition={{ duration: 2 }}
  whileHover={{
    scale: 1.2,
    transition: { duration: 1 },
  }}
/>
```

You can also define a seperate transition for each animating value. Any properties left unspecified can use a `default` transition:

```jsx
<motion.div
  animate={{ x: 100, y: 100 }}
  transition={{
    x: { type: "spring", stiffness: 400 },
    default: { ease: "easeIn" },
  }}
/>
```

You can add orchestration properties like `delay` that affect the whole animation. All durations in Framer Motion are defined in seconds.

```jsx
const transition = {
  delay: 1,
  opacity: { duration: 0.5 },
}
```

The `transition` property can also be specified inside your variants object and then passed to your `motion` component using the `variants` property.

```jsx
const variants = {
  hidden: {
    opacity: 0,
    transition: { duration: 0.25 },
  },
  visible: { opacity: 1 },
}

return <motion.div variants={variants} />
```
