# Animation

<span className="lead">
  How to animate in Framer Motion.
</span>

<div>

Animations in Framer Motion are controlled via the `motion` component's flexible `animate` property.

It can be used in a number of ways, scaling to the complexity of your needs.

In this guide, we'll explore each of them.

</div>

```jsx
import { motion } from "framer-motion"

export const MyComponent = () => (
  <motion.div
    animate={{ rotate: 360 }}
    transition={{ duration: 2 }}
  />
)
```

---

## Target object

For simple animations, we can set values directly on the `animate` prop.

```jsx
<motion.div animate={{ x: 100 }} />
```

When any value in `animate` changes, the component will automatically animate to the updated target.

### Transitions

By default, Motion will create an appropriate animation for a snappy transition based on the types of value being animated. For instance, physical properties like `x` or `scale` will be animated via a spring simulation. Whereas values like `opacity` or `color` will be animated with a tween.

However, you can set different types of animation by passing a [`Transition` to the `transition` prop](/api/motion/types#transition).

```jsx
<motion.div
  animate={{ x: 100 }}
  transition={{ ease: "easeOut", duration: 2 }}
/>
```

### Mount animations

When a component mounts, it'll automatically animate to the values in `animate` if they're different from those defined in `style` or `initial`. You can set the `initial` prop to `false` to use the value in `animate` as the component's mounted state to disable mount animations.

```jsx
<motion.div animate={{ x: 100 }} initial={false} />
```

This will also work with server-side rendering.

### Keyframes

<div>

Values in `animate` can also be set as a series of keyframes. This will animate through each value in sequence.

</div>

```jsx
<motion.feGaussianBlur
  animate={{ stdDeviation: [0, 5, 0] }}
/>
```

<div>

By default, a keyframes animation will start with the first item in the array. To use the **current** value instead, `null` can be passed as a placeholder. This way, if a keyframes animation starts while the value is currently animating, the transition will be more natural.

</div>

```jsx
<motion.circle cx={500} animate={{ cx: [null, 100] }} />
```

<div>

Each of these keyframes will be spaced equidistantly throughout the animation, but you can override this by setting a `times` prop on the `transition` prop.

This is an array of the same length as the animation target with numbers between `0` and `1` that define when in the animation each keyframe should be hit.

</div>

```jsx
<motion.circle
  cx={500}
  animate={{ cx: [null, 100, 200] }}
  transition={{ duration: 3, times: [0, 0.2, 1] }}
/>
```

## Variants

Target objects are useful for simple, single-component animations. But sometimes we want to create animations that propagate throughout the DOM, and orchestrate those animations in a declarative way. We can do so with variants.

<div>

Variants are sets of pre-defined target objects.

</div>

```jsx
const variants = {
  visible: { opacity: 1 },
  hidden: { opacity: 0 },
}
```

<div>

They're passed into `motion` components via the `variants` prop.

</div>

```jsx
<motion.div variants={variants} />
```

<div>

These variants can be referred to by label, whereever you can set an animation target.

</div>

```jsx
<motion.div
  initial="hidden"
  animate="visible"
  variants={variants}
/>
```

### Propagation

<div>

If a `motion` component has children, changes in variant will flow down through the component hierarchy. These changes in variant will flow down until a child component defines its own `animate` property.

</div>

```jsx
const list = {
  visible: { opacity: 1 },
  hidden: { opacity: 0 },
}

const item = {
  visible: { opacity: 1, x: 0 },
  hidden: { opacity: 0, x: -100 },
}

return (
  <motion.ul
    initial="hidden"
    animate="visible"
    variants={list}
  >
    <motion.li variants={item} />
    <motion.li variants={item} />
    <motion.li variants={item} />
  </motion.ul>
)
```

### Orchestration

<div>

By default, all these animations will start simultaneously. But by using variants, we gain access to extra `transition` props like `when`, `delayChildren`, and `staggerChildren` that can let parents orchestrate the execution of child animations.

</div>

```jsx
const list = {
  visible: {
    opacity: 1,
    transition: {
      when: "beforeChildren",
      staggerChildren: 0.3,
    },
  },
  hidden: {
    opacity: 0,
    transition: {
      when: "afterChildren",
    },
  },
}
```

### Dynamic variants

Each variant can be defined as a function that resolves when a variant is accessed. These variant functions are provided a single argument, which can be set in a component's `custom` prop.

```jsx
const variants = {
  visible: i => ({
    opacity: 1,
    transition: {
      delay: i * 0.3,
    },
  }),
  hidden: { opacity: 0 },
}

return items.map((item, i) => (
  <motion.li
    custom={i}
    animate="visible"
    variants={variants}
  />
))
```

## Animation controls

Declarative animations are ideal for most UI interactions. But sometimes we need to orchestrate more complex sequences.

The `useAnimation` hook can be used to create a set of [imperative `AnimationControls`](/api/motion/types/#animationcontrols) with a `start` and `stop` method. These controls can be passed to **one or more** `motion` components via the `animate` prop.

```jsx
const MyComponent = () => {
  const controls = useAnimation()

  return <motion.div animate={controls} />
}
```

### Starting an animation

<div>

Animations can be started with the `controls.start` method.

</div>

```jsx
controls.start({
  x: "100%",
  backgroundColor: "#f00",
  transition: { duration: 3 },
})
```

`start` accepts either a `TargetAndTransition` or, if the component(s) it's provided to has a `variants` property set, a variant label.

```jsx
controls.start("hidden")
```

### Sequencing

`start` returns a `Promise`, so it can be used to sequence animations using `await` or `then`.

Different controls can be sequenced together, and these sequences can be composed into functions that themselves can then be sequenced.

```jsx
const sequence = async () => {
  await menuControls.start({ x: 0 })
  return await itemControls.start({ opacity: 1 })
}
```

### Dynamic `start`

`start` can also accept a function that can dynamically start each component and the controls are bound to with a different animation definition.

Custom data can be sent to this function via the component's `custom` prop.

```jsx
const controls = useAnimation()

useEffect(() => {
  controls.start(i => ({
    opacity: 0,
    x: 100,
    transition: { delay: i * 0.3 },
  }))
}, [])

return (
  <ul>
    <motion.li custom={0} animate={controls} />
    <motion.li custom={1} animate={controls} />
    <motion.li custom={2} animate={controls} />
  </ul>
)
```

## Automatic (beta)

  <strong>Note:</strong> This feature is currently in beta.
  You can install the latest Framer Motion 2 beta using{" "}
  <code>npm install framer-motion@beta</code>.
</Callout>

<div>

A `motion` component can automatically animate layout and style changes that occur as a result of a re-render by setting `animate` to `true`.

These layout and style changes can be set via CSS applied via `className`, `style`, or inherited from a stylesheet.

</div>

```jsx
<motion.div animate />
```

### Layout animations

Auto-animating components will animate any changes to their layout. These layout changes can be anything: a change in the component's parent's flexbox, CSS grid, or switching between `position: absolute` and `position: fixed`.

For example, this component is animated by switching `justify-content` between `flex-start` and `flex-end`:

<iframe
  src="https://codesandbox.io/embed/framer-motion-magic-motion-switch-demo-0d68e?fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&theme=dark"
  style={{
    width: "100%",
    height: "500px",
    border: 0,
    borderRadius: 4,
    overflow: "hidden",
    marginBottom: 40,
  }}
  title="Framer Motion: Magic Motion switch demo"
  allow="geolocation; microphone; camera; midi; vr; accelerometer; gyroscope; payment; ambient-light-sensor; encrypted-media; usb"
  sandbox="allow-modals allow-forms allow-popups allow-scripts allow-same-origin"
></iframe>

All layout animations are performed using the `transform` property rather than properties like `width` or `top`. This results in smoother animations, because it does not trigger expensive layouts during the animation.

Animating `width` and `height` with `scaleX` and `scaleY` can sometimes visually distort children. You can correct this by also applying `animate` to those children if they are motion elements:

```jsx
<motion.div animate>
  <motion.div animate />
</motion.div>
```

<iframe
  src="https://codesandbox.io/embed/framer-motion-magic-motion-accordion-demo-tqzul?fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&theme=dark"
  style={{
    width: "100%",
    height: "500px",
    border: 0,
    borderRadius: 4,
    overflow: "hidden",
  }}
  title="Framer Motion: Magic Motion accordion demo"
  allow="geolocation; microphone; camera; midi; vr; accelerometer; gyroscope; payment; ambient-light-sensor; encrypted-media; usb"
  sandbox="allow-modals allow-forms allow-popups allow-scripts allow-same-origin"
></iframe>

### Style animations

The styles that will automatically animate are:

- `backgroundColor`
- `borderRadius` (and individual corners)
- `boxShadow` (currently single shadow only)
- `color`
- `opacity`

### Current limitations

- **Transform:** `animate` **doesn't** currently automatically animate `transform`, because the `transform` prop is currently reserved for performing layout animations.
- **Drag:** The `layoutTransition` prop that `animate={true}` replaces used to have a hacky way to integrate it with `drag` that powered the drag-to-reorder demos. The plan is to properly fix integration with `drag` rather than re-expose this kind of API.
- **Inline components:** Components that are set to `display: inline` aren't compatible with layout animations as they don't accept the CSS `transform` property. Try using `display: inline-block` instead.
- **SVG:** SVGs are currently not supported, but they will be soon.
